# Eloquent JavaScript Exercise Loader

A Repo with End-of-chapter exercises from the book Eloquent JavaScript 2nd edition solved and coded in JavaScript files.
It also contains an HTML file that serves as a sandbox to run the different scripts.

It's still a WIP. I intend to update it as I work through each of the exercises. I am doing this to brush up on my JavaScript skills
having gone a while without coding in JS.

Note: The scripts are more suited to be run in a browser environment since they make use of the DOM APIs.
